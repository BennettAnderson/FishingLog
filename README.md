# Bennett's Fishing Log

The best anglers keep a log of their fishing. The goal of this program is to provide an easy way to log fishing data and organize it in a way that can provide useful insight in an effort to increase fishing success.

## Project Goals

The main function of this project is to apply the Java skills I am learning to create a program that will be beneficial to the average angler.

## Functionality Goals

As my skills progress I hope to add the following functionality (not necessarily in order):

- Command line app that takes a trip report with data such as location, species caught, size, weather conditions, method used, time of year, and notes.
- Save data in user file and allow for multiple users.
- Allow for data searching, and provide analysis in a way that can provide valuable insight.
- Automatically generate moon cycles, weather information, and river levels.
- Create a GUI and include maps and visual data analysis.
